## Overview

GitHub is the world's largest source code hosting platform, serving 100M+ developers and hosting 400M+ repositories. Its architecture must handle massive Git operations (clone, push, pull) at scale, a sophisticated pull request review system, CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions, and a globally distributed CDN for repository access. Originally a Ruby on Rails monolith, GitHub has evolved into a service-oriented architecture while maintaining Git's decentralized model as its storage foundation. Acquired by Microsoft in 2018, GitHub runs on a hybrid of bare-metal servers and Azure cloud infrastructure.

## Key Components

<ComponentList>
<ComponentCard name="Git Backend Service">
Handles all Git protocol operations (clone, fetch, push, receive-pack). Written in Go, it interfaces with the on-disk Git repositories stored on a distributed filesystem. Supports Git LFS for large file storage and partial clone for monorepo performance.
</ComponentCard>
<ComponentCard name="Rails Monolith">
The original Ruby on Rails application that still powers the web UI, REST API, and much of the business logic. Handles authentication, repository settings, issues, pull requests, and user management. Being gradually decomposed into services.
</ComponentCard>
<ComponentCard name="Pull Request Service">
Manages PR lifecycle — creation, diff generation, review assignments, status checks, merge strategies (merge commit, squash, rebase). Computes diffs by invoking the Git backend and caches them for repeated access.
</ComponentCard>
<ComponentCard name="GitHub Actions">
A CI/CD platform that runs workflows on events (push, PR, schedule). Workflows are defined in YAML and executed on ephemeral virtual machines or containers. The service manages job queuing, runner allocation, artifact storage, and log streaming.
</ComponentCard>
<ComponentCard name="Code Search (Blackbird)">
GitHub's code search engine, codenamed Blackbird, indexes 200M+ repositories. Built on a custom Rust-based search engine that supports regex, symbol-aware queries, and language-specific parsing. Uses a novel index sharding strategy.
</ComponentCard>
<ComponentCard name="Package Registry">
Hosts packages for npm, Docker, Maven, NuGet, RubyGems, and more. Each ecosystem has its own resolution and metadata layer, but they share a common blob storage backend and CDN for package distribution.
</ComponentCard>

## Git Storage at Scale

GitHub stores **400M+ Git repositories** on disk, requiring a carefully designed storage architecture.

**Storage backend**: Repositories are stored as bare Git repositories on a distributed filesystem (historically NFS, evolving to Ceph-like systems). Each repository is a directory of Git objects (packfiles, loose objects, refs).

**Replication**: Every repository is replicated across three storage nodes for durability. Writes go to the primary, and replicas are updated asynchronously. GitHub uses a custom replication framework that ensures consistency at the Git ref level.

**Repository routing**: A routing layer maps each repository to its storage backend (which cluster, which shard). This allows GitHub to rebalance repositories across storage nodes without changing URLs.

**Monorepo challenges**: Large repositories with millions of files and deep history are expensive to clone. GitHub supports partial clone (download objects on demand) and sparse checkout to mitigate this. Git packfile bitmaps accelerate object enumeration for large repos.

## GitHub Actions Architecture

GitHub Actions is a full CI/CD platform built into GitHub, processing 30M+ workflow runs per day.

**Event-driven**: Workflows are triggered by repository events (push, pull_request, release, schedule, etc.). The event is matched against YAML workflow definitions, and matching jobs are enqueued.

**Runner infrastructure**: Jobs execute on ephemeral virtual machines (GitHub-hosted runners) or customer-managed self-hosted runners. Each GitHub-hosted runner is a fresh VM provisioned from a pre-baked image, ensuring isolation between jobs.

**Job orchestration**: A workflow can define multiple jobs with dependency graphs. The orchestrator resolves dependencies, allocates runners, streams logs in real time, and collects artifacts.

**Secrets management**: Secrets are encrypted at rest using libsodium sealed boxes. They are injected into the runner environment at execution time and never logged.

**Artifact and cache storage**: Build artifacts and dependency caches are stored in Azure Blob Storage with per-repository quotas and automatic expiration.

## Code Search with Blackbird

GitHub's code search engine, **Blackbird**, enables regex and symbol-aware search across 200M+ repositories.

**Indexing**: Blackbird crawls Git repositories and indexes their contents using a custom Rust-based indexer. It builds trigram and n-gram indices for fast substring matching, plus language-aware symbol tables for jump-to-definition queries.

**Sharding**: The search index is sharded by repository. Popular repositories and those belonging to paying customers are indexed with higher priority. The total index size is in the petabyte range.

**Query execution**: A query like `language:go repo:kubernetes/kubernetes func.*Handler` is decomposed into a filter phase (language, repo scope) and a search phase (regex matching against the filtered index). Results are ranked by repository popularity and match quality.

**Incremental updates**: When a push event occurs, only the changed files are re-indexed. This keeps the index fresh within minutes of a push, even at GitHub's scale.

## Architectural Tradeoffs

  pros={["Leverages Git's battle-tested storage format", 'No abstraction layer — direct filesystem access is fast', 'Compatible with all Git tooling']}
  cons={['Filesystem-level sharding is operationally complex', 'NFS can be a bottleneck for hot repositories', 'Garbage collection and repacking require careful scheduling']}
/>

<Tradeoff
