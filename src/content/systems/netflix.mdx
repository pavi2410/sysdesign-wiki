## Open Connect CDN Architecture

Netflix's **Open Connect** is one of the largest CDNs in the world, purpose-built for video delivery.

**How it works:**
- Netflix places custom server appliances (OCAs) **inside ISP networks** worldwide
- During off-peak hours, new content is proactively **pushed** to OCAs based on predicted demand
- When a user presses play, they're directed to the **closest OCA** that has the content

**OCA Specifications:**
- Custom-built servers with 100+ TB SSD storage
- Optimized FreeBSD-based OS with custom TCP stack
- Single OCA can serve 100+ Gbps of video
- ~18,000 OCAs in 6,000+ locations worldwide

**Content Placement Algorithm:**
- Predicts what content will be popular in each region
- Fills OCAs during off-peak hours (typically 2am-8am local time)
- Popular content replicated across more OCAs for redundancy

**95% of Netflix traffic never crosses the internet backbone**, reducing costs and improving quality.

## Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

Netflix uses adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming to deliver the best quality for each user's network conditions.

**Per-Title Encoding:**
Instead of fixed encoding ladders, Netflix analyzes each title's visual complexity and creates a **custom encoding ladder**:
- Simple animation might look perfect at 1.5 Mbps in 1080p
- An action movie might need 8 Mbps for the same resolution
- Saves 20% bandwidth on average while maintaining quality

**Per-Shot Encoding:**
- Static dialogue scenes get lower bitrates
- Fast-action sequences get higher bitrates
- Smooth transitions between quality levels

**Client-Side ABR Algorithm:**
1. Maintains a ~30-second playback buffer
2. Measures download speed of recent segments
3. Selects the highest sustainable quality
4. Upgrades/downgrades smoothly between segments

Netflix encodes each title into **~120 different streams** (resolution, bitrate, codec, HDR combinations).

## Chaos Engineering & Resilience

Netflix pioneered **chaos engineering** — intentionally introducing failures to build system resilience.

**Key Tools:**
- **Chaos Monkey**: Randomly terminates production instances
- **Chaos Kong**: Simulates entire AWS region failure
- **Latency Monkey**: Introduces artificial delays

**Resilience Patterns:**
- **Circuit Breakers**: Calls to failing services are short-circuited with fallbacks
- **Bulkheads**: Thread pool isolation prevents cascade failures
- **Fallbacks**: Every service has degraded-mode responses
- **Retries with backoff**: Exponential backoff with jitter

The philosophy: "The best way to avoid failure is to fail constantly." By regularly testing failure scenarios in production, Netflix ensures graceful handling of real failures.
