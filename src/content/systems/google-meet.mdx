## Overview

Google Meet is a video conferencing service built on open web standards (WebRTC) and tightly integrated with Google Workspace (Calendar, Gmail, Docs). It supports meetings of up to 1,000 participants with live streaming to 100,000 viewers. Meet's architecture leverages Google's global network backbone for low-latency media transport, server-side media processing for adaptive quality, and a progressive web approach that requires no client installation. Its design prioritizes reliability, accessibility, and seamless integration over protocol-level customization.

## WebRTC and OASIS Media Routing

Meet is built entirely on **WebRTC**, the open standard for real-time communication in browsers. This means no plugin or desktop app is required — any modern browser can join a meeting.

**OASIS** is Google's custom media relay infrastructure, deployed at 200+ edge Points of Presence (PoPs) globally. When a participant sends video, it travels to the nearest PoP, then traverses Google's private backbone (not the public internet) to reach other participants' nearest PoPs.

**Simulcast**: Each client sends multiple quality layers of their video (e.g., 720p, 360p, 180p). The OASIS router selects which layer to forward to each recipient based on their available bandwidth and display size. This avoids server-side transcoding for most cases.

**Bandwidth estimation**: OASIS performs server-side bandwidth estimation for each participant using REMB/transport-cc feedback. When a participant's network degrades, the router instantly switches to a lower simulcast layer — the sender doesn't need to change anything.

## Server-side Noise Cancellation

Meet performs **server-side noise cancellation** using a deep learning model, a differentiator from most competitors that rely on client-side processing.

**Why server-side?**: Running the ML model server-side means it works on every device — including low-powered Chromebooks and phones — without draining the battery. It also ensures consistent quality regardless of client hardware.

**Model architecture**: A lightweight RNN-based model processes audio frames in real time with &lt;10ms additional latency. It separates human speech from background noise (typing, construction, pets, etc.).

**Deployment**: The model runs on Google's TPU infrastructure at the media processing layer. Each audio stream is processed independently before being forwarded to other participants.

## Google Workspace Integration

Meet's deep integration with Google Workspace is a core architectural decision that shapes its design.

**Calendar-native**: Meetings are created as Calendar events. The meeting ID and join link are embedded in the event, and Calendar handles invitations, reminders, and RSVP tracking. There's no separate meeting management system.

**Gmail integration**: Meet links appear in Gmail, and users can join meetings directly from email threads. Meeting notes are auto-linked to Calendar events and stored in Google Docs.

**Drive integration**: Recordings and transcripts are automatically saved to the organizer's Google Drive with appropriate sharing permissions inherited from the Calendar event.

**Authentication**: Meet uses Google's centralized identity system. Workspace admins control meeting policies (who can join, recording permissions, etc.) via the Admin Console, which propagates to Meet through Google's policy engine.

## Architectural Tradeoffs

<Tradeoff
  decision="WebRTC standard over proprietary protocol"
  pros={["Works in any browser — no installation needed", "Open standard with broad ecosystem support", "Rapid iteration on web platform features"]}
  cons={["Constrained by browser WebRTC implementation differences", "Less control over codec selection than proprietary solutions", "Browser updates can introduce regressions"]}
/>

<Tradeoff
  decision="Server-side media processing over client-side"
  pros={["Consistent quality across all devices", "Enables features on low-powered hardware", "Centralized noise cancellation and transcription"]}
  cons={["Higher server infrastructure cost", "Adds a few ms of latency per hop", "Requires massive GPU/TPU fleet for ML inference"]}
/>

<Tradeoff
  decision="Tight Workspace integration over standalone product"
  pros={["Seamless user experience within the ecosystem", "Shared identity, permissions, and storage", "Reduces separate infrastructure needs"]}
  cons={["Less appealing to non-Google Workspace users", "Feature coupling — Workspace outages affect Meet", "Harder to use in mixed-ecosystem organizations"]}
